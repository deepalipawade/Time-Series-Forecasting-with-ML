# Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning

Understanding timely patterns/characteristics in data are becoming very critical aspect in analyzing and describing trends in business data. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for time series forecasting. The goal of this project is to forecast future values in a time series by applying machine learning models, showcasing their application to real-world datasets.

## Project Overview

Time series forecasting is critical in various domains such as finance, economics, and inventory management. Traditional forecasting methods, such as ARIMA, work well for linear relationships but often fail to capture complex patterns in the data. This project explores the power of machine learning models, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, to improve predictive accuracy in time series forecasting.

## Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling the data to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Feature Creation:** Creating lag features, rolling statistics, and date-based features to capture trends, seasonality, and dependencies in the time series.
- **Modeling:** Training machine learning models including Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest, and others to forecast future time series values.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), and comparing results with traditional methods.
- **Visualization:** Plotting the results of model predictions against the actual time series data to visually assess the accuracy and performance of the models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Results and Insights
Machine learning models were able to capture complex patterns in the time series data, providing more accurate forecasts compared to traditional methods. Through this project, we explore how feature engineering and advanced machine learning techniques can significantly improve forecasting accuracy.
