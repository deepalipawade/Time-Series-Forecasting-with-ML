# Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning

Understanding timely patterns/characteristics in data are becoming very critical aspect in analyzing and describing trends in business data. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for time series forecasting. The goal of this project is to forecast future values in a time series by applying machine learning models, showcasing their application to real-world datasets.

## Project Overview

Time series forecasting is critical in various domains such as finance, economics, and inventory management. Traditional forecasting methods, such as ARIMA, work well for linear relationships but often fail to capture complex patterns in the data. This project explores the power of machine learning models, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, to improve predictive accuracy in time series forecasting.

## Part One

In the first part of the project, various machine-learning techniques are used to forecast time series data. The focus is on understanding how standard machine learning models can be adapted to deal with time-dependent data. Key aspects include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling the data to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Feature Creation:** Creating lag features, rolling statistics, and date-based features to capture trends, seasonality, and dependencies in the time series.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data to extract valuable insights for model development.
- **Modeling:** Training machine learning models including Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest, and others to forecast future time series values.
- **Cross-Validation:** Using time series cross-validation techniques to ensure robust model performance over different time periods.
- **Visualization:** Plotting the results of model predictions against the actual time series data to visually assess the accuracy and performance of the models.

This part is to establish a solid foundation for time series forecasting using traditional machine learning techniques and compare their performance on different evaluation metrics.

## Part two 

In the second part, advanced machine learning techniques are used by applying XGBoost, a powerful gradient-boosting algorithm, to improve time series forecasting accuracy. This part of the project builds on the concepts from Part 1 and introduces more complex methods for dealing with time-dependent data.

- **Feature Engineering:** Advanced feature creation, including time-based features and rolling statistics, to enhance model performance.
- **Modeling with XGBoost:** Implementing and fine-tuning the XGBoost algorithm to improve predictive power and handle the intricacies of time series data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model, balancing performance and computational efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing the XGBoost model's performance against traditional machine learning models using metrics like RMSE and MAE to assess forecasting accuracy.

This part demonstrates how gradient-boosting techniques like XGBoost, can be  effective for time series forecasting when combined with proper feature engineering and model tuning.
